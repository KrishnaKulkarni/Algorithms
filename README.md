Algorithms
==========

I find analyzing and constructing algorithms to be one of the most fun and captivating aspects of programming. 
This repo is a sample that highlights work I've done before with algorithms, a collection of algorithms I 
programmed that were fun, interesting, or clever.


The folder Recursive Exercises contains several exercises recreating classic recursive algorithms including:
- computing fibonacci numbers
- computing exponentials
- Mergesort
- generating a comprehensive list of subsets, given a set
- Making change optimally given a coin set and amount to me made change of

Recursion is clearly a pretty neat technique for solving problems, and one for which I hope to continually hone my skills.
